    const DESCRIPTIONS = {
      "Head": {
      title:'Head', 
      meta:'Sensory and feeding center', 
      html:'<p>The head of a honey bee serves as the primary sensory and feeding center, housing sophisticated neural processing capabilities within a compact chitinous capsule.This region contains the bee brain, which processes information from multiple sensory organs to coordinate flight, navigation, and social behaviors. The head structure is specially adapted to accommodate powerful mandibular muscles for various tasks from feeding to wax manipulation. It also supports the proboscis, a complex tubular feeding structure that can extend and retract for nectar collection. The head shape and orientation allow for optimal visual field coverage while maintaining aerodynamic efficiency during flight.</p>'
    },
      "Compound Eye": {
      title:'Compound Eye',
      meta:'Vision & navigation',
      html:'<p>The compound eyes are remarkable biological structures consisting of thousands of individual optical units called ommatidia, each functioning as a separate light-detecting element that contributes to a mosaic-like image. These eyes provide honey bees with exceptional motion detection capabilities, allowing them to track movements and navigate through complex three-dimensional environments with extraordinary precision. The compound eyes are particularly sensitive to ultraviolet light, enabling bees to see patterns on flowers that are completely invisible to human vision, such as nectar guides that direct them to pollen and nectar sources. The positioning of these large eyes on either side of the head provides nearly 360-degree visual coverage, crucial for avoiding predators and obstacles during flight. Worker bees possess approximately 5,500 ommatidia per eye, while drones have even more to aid in their primary function of locating queens during mating flights.</p>'
    },
      "Ocelli": {
      title:'Ocelli',
      meta:'Light sensors',
      html:'<p>Ocelli are three simple eyes arranged in a triangular pattern on the top of the bee head, functioning as light intensity sensors rather than image-forming organs like the compound eyes. These photoreceptive organs play a crucial role in flight stabilization by detecting changes in light levels and helping the bee maintain proper orientation relative to the horizon and sun position. The ocelli work in conjunction with the compound eyes to provide rapid responses to sudden changes in ambient light, which is essential for quick aerial maneuvers. Research suggests these simple eyes also contribute to the bee circadian rhythm regulation and help synchronize their internal biological clock with external day-night cycles. The neural pathways from the ocelli connect directly to flight control centers in the brain, enabling instantaneous corrections to flight posture.</p>'
    },
      "Antennae": {
      title:'Antennae',
      meta:'Olfaction & touch',
      html:'<p>The antennae are extraordinarily sophisticated sensory appendages covered with thousands of chemoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, and thermoreceptors that allow bees to perceive their environment through touch, smell, taste, and even detect minute air currents. Each antenna consists of a scape (base segment), pedicel (second segment), and a flagellum composed of multiple segments that contain specialized sensory structures called sensilla. These organs are essential for chemical communication within the hive, enabling bees to detect and interpret pheromones that coordinate colony activities, from queen recognition to alarm responses. The antennae can detect carbon dioxide concentrations, helping bees locate flowers through their respiration signature, and they are sensitive enough to measure humidity levels and air movement patterns. During the famous waggle dance, bees use their antennae to follow the dancing bee movements in the dark hive, translating mechanical vibrations into spatial information about food source locations.</p>'
    },
      "Jaw": {
      title:'Jaw',
      meta:'Manipulation & grooming',
      html:'<p>The mandibles are powerful, hardened mouthparts that serve multiple essential functions beyond simple feeding, acting as versatile tools for construction, defense, and social behaviors within the colony. These jaw-like structures are used by worker bees to manipulate and shape beeswax during comb construction, demonstrating remarkable precision in creating the hexagonal cells that characterize honeycomb architecture. The mandibles also function as grooming tools, allowing bees to clean their antennae and other body parts, remove debris from the hive, and assist nestmates in maintaining colony hygiene. During defensive behaviors, bees use their mandibles to bite intruders, and they are essential for removing dead bees or debris from the hive entrance. Additionally, mandibular glands associated with these structures produce various pheromones, including the queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) in queen bees, which suppresses worker ovary development and maintains social cohesion.</p>'
    },
      "Thorax": {
      title:'Thorax',
      meta:'Flight & locomotion',
      html:'<p>The thorax is the powerhouse of the bee body, a robust middle segment packed with massive flight muscles that can contract up to 230 times per second to power the wings and generate the characteristic buzzing sound. This region consists of three fused segments (prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax), each bearing a pair of legs, while the meso- and metathorax also support the two pairs of wings. The indirect flight muscles within the thorax do not attach directly to the wings but instead deform the thoracic cuticle, causing rapid wing beats through a click mechanism that allows for highly efficient energy use. The thorax also houses the honey crop entrance and contains vital ganglia that coordinate leg and wing movements with split-second precision. Temperature regulation is critical in the thorax, as flight muscles generate substantial heat; bees can actively thermoregulate by decoupling wing movement from muscle contraction, essentially shivering to warm the hive or themselves.</p>'
    },
      "Fore Legs": {
      title:'Fore Legs',
      meta:'Cleaning',
      html:'<p>The fore legs are specialized appendages equipped with unique grooming structures, most notably the antenna cleaner, a semicircular notch with a comb-like structure on the first tarsal segment that allows bees to meticulously clean their antennae. This cleaning mechanism is essential because antennae are the bee primary chemical sensors, and any contamination with pollen, dust, or propolis could impair their ability to communicate and navigate effectively. The fore legs also feature brushes of setae (hair-like structures) that help collect pollen from the head and anterior parts of the body during the grooming process. These legs are the most mobile and dexterous of the three pairs, capable of reaching most parts of the bee head and body for maintenance activities. During flower visitation, the fore legs make first contact with the blossom, and their sensory receptors help the bee assess the quality and quantity of available nectar and pollen.</p>'
    },
      "Middle Legs": {
      title:'Middle Legs',
      meta:'Walking & pollen transfer',
      html:'<p>The middle legs serve as transitional limbs that bridge the functions of the fore and hind legs, playing crucial roles in locomotion, grooming, and pollen manipulation during foraging activities. These legs are equipped with a tibial spur, a sharp, movable spine that bees use to pry pollen loads from the pollen baskets on their hind legs when returning to the hive, essentially acting as a lever to remove the collected pollen. The middle legs also assist in transferring pollen from the front of the body to the hind legs during the complex grooming and packing sequence that foragers perform while moving between flowers. Their position provides optimal leverage for various hive activities, including walking on comb surfaces, maintaining balance during construction work, and supporting the bee weight during rest. The middle legs joints and musculature are designed to provide stability during the rapid leg movements required for the bee walking gait pattern.</p>'
    },
      "Hind Legs": {
      title:'Hind Legs',
      meta:'Pollen transport',
      html:'<p>The hind legs are remarkably specialized structures featuring the corbicula or pollen basket, a smooth, slightly concave area on the outer surface of the tibia surrounded by long, curved hairs that function to hold and transport large quantities of pollen back to the hive. Worker bees possess a sophisticated pollen press mechanism formed by the tibia and basitarsus that compresses moistened pollen into compact pellets, which are then transferred to the pollen baskets through a series of precise leg movements. The hind legs also feature the pollen comb, rows of stiff bristles on the inner surface of the basitarsus that scrape pollen from the body and opposite leg during grooming. These legs are essential for propolis collection, as bees use them to carry sticky plant resins that they gather with their mandibles. The hind legs length and positioning make them ideal for stabilization during various hive activities, and their powerful musculature enables bees to perform the ventilation fanning behavior that regulates hive temperature and humidity.</p>'
    },
      "Wings": {
      title:'Wings',
      meta:'Flight',
      html:'<p>Honey bee wings are marvels of biological engineering, consisting of thin, transparent membranes supported by a network of veins (made of hardened cuticle) that provide structural integrity while maintaining remarkable flexibility and lightness. The two pairs of wings can interlock during flight through a series of tiny hooks called hamuli on the hindwing that catch onto a fold on the forewing, effectively creating a single airfoil surface that increases lift and flight efficiency. The wing venation pattern is not only structurally important but also taxonomically significant, as the arrangement of veins is used by scientists to identify different bee species and subspecies. During flight, bees can beat their wings at frequencies exceeding 200 beats per second, generating enough lift to carry their body weight plus additional cargo of nectar and pollen that may equal or exceed their body mass. Wings also serve non-flight functions, including fanning behavior for hive ventilation and temperature regulation, and they can be used to produce specific vibrations during communication, such as the piping sounds made by virgin queens.</p>'
    },
      "Abdomen": {
      title:'Abdomen',
      meta:'Visceral organs',
      html:'<p>The abdomen is a segmented, flexible structure that houses most of the bee vital organs, including the digestive system, reproductive organs, wax glands, and venom apparatus, making it essential for both individual survival and colony function. This posterior body region consists of visible tergites (dorsal plates) and sternites (ventral plates) connected by flexible intersegmental membranes that allow for expansion when consuming nectar or honey and contraction during respiration and sting extension. The abdomen contains the honey stomach or crop, a specialized expandable storage organ that allows foragers to carry nectar without digesting it, keeping it separate from their own digestive tract through a valve mechanism. Worker bees possess four pairs of wax glands on the ventral surface of abdominal segments that secrete liquid wax, which hardens into scales that can be manipulated with the mandibles and legs to construct comb. The abdomen telescoping capability enables bees to extend their sting apparatus, and its distinctive banding pattern (varying between species) provides visual signals for recognition and serves as warning coloration to potential predators.</p>'
    },
      "Sting": {
      title:'Sting',
      meta:'Defense',
      html:'<p>The sting apparatus is a highly modified ovipositor (egg-laying organ) found in female bees that has evolved into a sophisticated defensive weapon consisting of a sharp, barbed stylet, venom sac, and associated musculature that can continue injecting venom even after detaching from the bee body. The sting shaft features backward-facing barbs that anchor it in mammalian skin, causing the entire venom apparatus to tear away from the bee abdomen when she attempts to fly away, resulting in the bee death but ensuring maximum venom delivery to the target. The venom itself is a complex cocktail of enzymes, peptides (including melittin and apamin), and histamine-releasing compounds that cause immediate pain, followed by inflammation and immune responses in victims. Worker bees can sting other insects and arthropods without losing their stingers because the barbs do not catch on the hard exoskeleton, allowing for repeated defensive actions against these threats. The sting apparatus also plays a role in pheromone production, as alarm pheromones are released during stinging events, chemically alerting nearby bees to potential threats and coordinating collective defensive responses that can involve hundreds or thousands of defenders.</p>'

      "Maxilla": {
      title: 'Maxilla', 
      meta: 'Secondary mouthpart manipulator', 
      html: '<p>The maxillae are a pair of sophisticated mouthparts located lateral to the mandibles that serve as essential components of the honey bee\'s feeding apparatus, working in coordination with the labium to form the proboscis used for liquid feeding. Each maxilla consists of several articulated segments including the cardo (basal hinge), stipes (support structure), galea (blade-like lobe), and maxillary palps (sensory appendages), all working together to manipulate food and create sealed feeding channels. The elongated galea portions of the maxillae form the lateral walls of the food canal when the bee extends its proboscis, enclosing the central glossa (tongue) and creating a functional tube through which nectar can be drawn by capillary action and muscular pumping. The maxillae are equipped with numerous chemosensory and mechanosensory receptors, particularly on the maxillary palps, allowing bees to taste and assess food quality, detect appropriate nectar concentrations, and make foraging decisions based on resource profitability. During feeding, the maxillae work dynamically, adjusting their position to maintain seal integrity while the glossa laps up nectar, and they can fold back compactly against the head when not in use, demonstrating the remarkable morphological flexibility that allows bees to switch between different feeding modes and perform various hive tasks beyond nectar collection.</p>'
    },
      "Labrum": {
      title: 'Labrum', 
      meta: 'Upper lip and protective cover', 
      html: '<p>The labrum is a broad, movable flap that functions as the upper lip of the honey bee, providing essential protection for the more delicate mouthparts located beneath it, including the mandibles and proboscis components. This chitinous plate acts as a protective shield during feeding activities, preventing debris and foreign particles from entering the mouth while the bee manipulates food sources. The labrum works in coordination with other mouthparts to create a sealed feeding channel when the bee extends its proboscis into flowers, ensuring efficient nectar uptake without spillage. Its inner surface contains sensory receptors that help the bee assess food quality and texture before ingestion. The labrum\'s flexibility allows it to fold back during mandible use for tasks like wax manipulation and hive construction, demonstrating the remarkable versatility of bee mouthpart adaptations.</p>'
    },

      "Hypopharyngeal gland": {
      title: 'Hypopharyngeal Gland', 
      meta: 'Royal jelly production center', 
      html: '<p>The hypopharyngeal glands are paired secretory organs located in the head of worker bees that undergo remarkable age-related functional changes, producing different substances depending on the bee\'s role within the colony. In young nurse bees (approximately 6-12 days old), these glands are highly active and produce royal jelly, a protein-rich, milky-white secretion that serves as the exclusive food for the queen throughout her life and for all larvae during their first three days of development. Royal jelly contains a complex mixture of proteins, vitamins, fatty acids, and the crucial compound royalactin, which triggers the developmental pathway that transforms a female larva into a queen rather than a worker. As worker bees age and transition to foraging duties, the hypopharyngeal glands atrophy and shift function to produce enzymes, particularly invertase and glucose oxidase, which are mixed with nectar to begin the honey-making process. The health and productivity of these glands directly impact colony nutrition, brood rearing success, and overall hive vitality, making them essential to the colony\'s reproductive success and survival.</p>'

These jaw-like structures are controlled by strong adductor and abductor muscles that provide exceptional gripping force, allowing worker bees to precisely shape and mold beeswax into the perfect hexagonal cells that comprise the honeycomb architecture, a task requiring both strength and remarkable precision. During foraging, mandibles help bees harvest pollen by scraping anthers and manipulate propolis (plant resins) by chewing and mixing it with salivary secretions before transport. The mandibles serve critical hygienic functions, including removing dead bees, diseased larvae, and debris from the hive, as well as grooming behaviors where bees clean themselves and nestmates to maintain colony health. In defensive situations, guard bees use their mandibles to bite intruders, and the associated mandibular glands produce alarm pheromones and, in queens, the queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) that regulates worker behavior and suppresses ovary development, demonstrating the mandibles\' integral role in both physical tasks and chemical communication.</p>'

The salivary secretions serve as a lubricant for food manipulation, moistening dry pollen grains to make them easier to consume and helping to form the pollen-nectar mixture that bees pack into cells as bee bread for larval consumption. During the honey-making process, salivary enzymes mix with regurgitated nectar to catalyze the conversion of complex sugars into simpler forms, contributing to honey\'s long-term preservation properties and distinctive composition. The glands also produce secretions used in wax manipulation, as bees moisten wax scales to make them pliable enough for construction work.

The pharyngeal walls are equipped with muscles that generate suction pressure, which is particularly important when bees draw nectar through their proboscis from deep within flowers, essentially functioning as a biological pump that can work against gravity and surface tension. The pharynx also contains sensory receptors that allow bees to taste and assess food quality before committing to full ingestion, providing a final checkpoint for contaminated or unsuitable food sources. During regurgitation behaviors, such as trophallaxis (food sharing between colony members) or honey deposition into comb cells, the pharynx works in reverse, helping to move stored crop contents back up through the mouth for distribution or storage, demonstrating its bidirectional functionality essential to social food exchange and honey production.</p>'

The esophageal walls are lined with a thin cuticle that protects the tissue while maintaining flexibility necessary for the passage of both liquid nectar and more solid pollen masses that bees consume. The esophagus passes through the thorax\'s narrow space between flight muscles and other vital organs, representing an elegant anatomical solution to connecting the feeding apparatus with the digestive and storage systems. During nectar foraging, the esophagus must transport large volumes of liquid quickly and efficiently, as foragers may fill their honey stomach to capacity with nectar that approaches or exceeds their own body weight. The esophagus also functions during trophallaxis and food regurgitation, working bidirectionally to allow bees to share food with nestmates and deposit processed nectar into storage cells, making it essential for both individual nutrition and colony-level food distribution networks.</p>'

The brain\'s remarkable efficiency allows bees to perform cognitive feats such as the waggle dance communication system, where foragers encode and transmit precise distance and directional information about food sources to nestmates, requiring integration of solar position, landscape features, and distance traveled. Honey bees demonstrate associative learning capabilities, forming memories that link specific floral scents, colors, and patterns with nectar rewards, and can even grasp abstract concepts like "sameness" and "difference" in controlled experiments. The brain coordinates all motor functions from flight mechanics and leg movements to precise sting deployment, while simultaneously processing input from thousands of sensory receptors on the antennae, compound eyes, ocelli, and body surface, making it one of nature\'s most impressive examples of neural miniaturization and computational efficiency in proportion to brain size.</p>'

The ocelli\'s simple optical structure allows for extremely fast response times to changing light conditions, much quicker than the compound eyes, making them essential for flight stabilization and rapid course corrections during aerial maneuvers. These simple eyes contribute significantly to the bee\'s ability to maintain stable flight orientation by detecting the contrast between sky and ground, helping the bee determine which direction is "up" even when visual landmarks are obscured or during rapid flight through complex environments. The neural pathways from ocelli connect directly to flight control centers in the thoracic ganglia, bypassing higher processing centers for immediate reflex responses, and they also play roles in circadian rhythm regulation, helping bees synchronize their internal biological clocks with natural day-night cycles. Research suggests that ocelli may also contribute to the detection of polarized light patterns in the sky, which bees use for navigation, working in conjunction with specialized regions of the compound eyes to create a comprehensive celestial compass system.</p>'

The strategic positioning of thoracic air sacs adjacent to the massive flight muscles serves a dual purpose: providing a readily available oxygen reservoir to fuel the intense metabolic demands of flight, which requires extraordinary energy expenditure, and helping to dissipate the substantial heat generated by muscle activity. During flight, the rhythmic compression and expansion of these air sacs, coordinated with wing beats and abdominal pumping movements, creates an active ventilation system that is far more efficient than simple diffusion, enabling bees to achieve the high oxygen delivery rates necessary for sustained flight. The air sacs also contribute to the bee\'s overall buoyancy and may play a role in reducing body density, potentially offering slight aerodynamic advantages. Additionally, these structures help regulate internal pressure during rapid altitude changes and contribute to the production of buzzing sounds, as air moving through the connected tracheal system during wing beats creates the characteristic frequencies we associate with bee flight.</p>'

This muscular tube features several chambers with one-way valves called ostia that allow hemolymph to enter from the body cavity during diastole (relaxation phase) and prevent backflow during systole (contraction phase) when fluid is propelled forward toward the head. The dorsal vessel contracts in rhythmic, wave-like peristaltic movements that originate at the posterior end and travel anteriorly, generating the pressure necessary to circulate hemolymph through the body cavity where it directly bathes organs and tissues, delivering nutrients and removing metabolic wastes. Unlike vertebrate blood, bee hemolymph does not transport oxygen (this function is handled by the separate tracheal system), but instead carries dissolved nutrients, hormones, immune cells (hemocytes), and waste products while maintaining osmotic balance and providing hydraulic pressure for various body functions. The heart rate varies dramatically with the bee\'s activity level, ambient temperature, and physiological state, beating faster during flight and foraging activities and slower during rest, with rates ranging from approximately 60 beats per minute at rest to over 150 beats per minute during active flight.

The abdominal air sacs undergo rhythmic expansion and compression during specialized fanning behavior, where bees position themselves at the hive entrance and use their wings and body movements to create directional airflow that regulates hive temperature and humidity while refreshing the air inside the colony. During flight, the mechanical compression of abdominal segments synchronized with wing beats creates an auxiliary respiratory pump that substantially increases oxygen delivery to metabolically active flight muscles and other tissues, supporting the extreme energy demands of sustained aerial activity. The large volume of the abdominal air sacs also provides a thermal buffer, helping to insulate vital organs from rapid temperature fluctuations and contributing to the bee\'s remarkable ability to thermoregulate both individually and collectively as a colony.

These tubes have walls reinforced with spiral thickenings called taenidia, which prevent collapse under pressure while maintaining flexibility, allowing the tracheal system to accommodate body movements during walking, flight, and the telescoping of abdominal segments. The tracheal network begins at paired openings called spiracles located along the sides of the thorax and abdomen, which can open and close to regulate air exchange and prevent water loss, then branches repeatedly into progressively finer tubes called tracheoles that ultimately reach individual cells where oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs. The finest tracheoles have walls thin enough for gases to diffuse directly across them, with some tracheoles actually penetrating into large cells or being filled with fluid that enhances gas exchange through solution and diffusion. The tracheal system\'s direct oxygen delivery mechanism is highly efficient for small organisms like bees, enabling the extraordinary metabolic rates required for flight, but it also represents a size constraint, as this system becomes less effective in larger bodies due to diffusion limitations. The tracheal network is intimately connected with air sacs in both the thorax and abdomen, which act as reservoirs and ventilation pumps, and the entire system is actively ventilated through coordinated body movements that create pressure changes driving bulk airflow rather than depending solely on passive diffusion, particularly during high-oxygen-demand activities like flight or thermoregulation.</p>'

This fibromuscular septum undergoes rhythmic contractions independent of the dorsal vessel (heart), creating localized pressure changes that help drive hemolymph circulation through the ventral region of the body and assist in returning hemolymph toward the posterior where it can re-enter the dorsal vessel through the ostia. The ventral diaphragm works in coordination with the dorsal vessel to establish a circular flow pattern: hemolymph is pumped forward through the dorsal vessel, disperses into the body cavity to bathe organs and tissues, then flows backward along the ventral diaphragm before being collected again by the heart. This arrangement is particularly important for ensuring adequate hemolymph circulation to the legs, ventral nerve cord, and ventral body wall, regions that might otherwise receive inadequate perfusion in a simple open circulatory system. The diaphragm\'s contractions also contribute to mixing of hemolymph, preventing stratification of nutrients or waste products and ensuring more uniform distribution of hormones, immune cells, and metabolic compounds throughout the hemocoel.

The venom itself contains over 40 different compounds including melittin, phospholipase A2, hyaluronidase, and various biogenic amines that cause immediate pain, tissue damage, and inflammatory responses. The sting apparatus also produces alarm pheromones that chemically alert nearby bees to the threat, coordinating collective defensive responses.

        html: '<p>The thoracic ganglion is a fused neural center that represents one of the most sophisticated motor control systems in the insect world, coordinating the incredibly complex flight mechanics and leg movements that enable honey bees to perform their remarkable aerial capabilities and precise terrestrial locomotion. This enlarged ganglion contains thousands of motor neurons, interneurons, and sensory processing units that integrate information from wing sensors, proprioceptors, visual systems, and balance organs to maintain stable flight and execute complex maneuvers with extraordinary precision. The ganglion controls the indirect flight muscles that power wing beats at frequencies exceeding 200 beats per second, coordinating the precise timing and force generation required for lift, thrust, and directional control during flight. It also manages the intricate coordination between the two pairs of wings, ensuring they work together as a single aerodynamic unit through the coupling and uncoupling of wing hooks (hamuli) as needed for different flight modes. The thoracic ganglion processes sensory feedback from mechanoreceptors in the wing bases and leg joints, allowing for real-time adjustments to flight posture and walking gait patterns in response to changing conditions. This neural center also coordinates complex behaviors such as the waggle dance, where precise body movements and wing vibrations encode spatial information about food sources for communication with nestmates. The ganglion contains specialized circuits for different types of locomotion, from hovering and rapid directional changes during foraging to the precise movements required for comb construction and other hive activities.</p>'

        meta: 'Social food storage system',
        html: '<p>The crop, commonly referred to as the honey stomach, represents one of the most remarkable adaptations for eusocial life, functioning as a living storage vessel that enables individual bees to serve as mobile food reservoirs for the entire colony. This expandable organ can stretch to accommodate nectar loads that approach or exceed the bee body weight, transforming individual foragers into efficient cargo carriers that maximize the energy return on foraging investments. The crop walls contain specialized muscle fibers arranged in both circular and longitudinal orientations, allowing for controlled expansion during filling and precise contraction during regurgitation, enabling bees to transfer exact quantities of food to recipients during trophallaxis. Within the crop, collected nectar undergoes initial processing through the addition of enzymes from various glandular sources, beginning the complex biochemical transformations that convert raw nectar into mature honey with its characteristic composition and antimicrobial properties. The crop contents remain separate from the bee personal digestive system through the action of the proventriculus valve, allowing foragers to transport food for colony use without depleting their own energy reserves. This organ also serves emergency functions, as bees can access crop contents for personal nutrition during extended flights, adverse weather conditions, or when separated from the colony. The crop capacity and efficiency directly impact colony foraging success, and its proper function is essential for the complex food distribution networks that characterize advanced eusocial societies.</p>'
